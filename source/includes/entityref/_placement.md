# Placement

Represents a successfully filled job; for example, a placement of a candidate in a job. Each Placement record corresponds to a single JobOrder and a single Candidate, although a JobOrder may have multiple Placements associated with it. For example, a company could hire several people for the same position. The Placement entity supports the massupdate operations.
