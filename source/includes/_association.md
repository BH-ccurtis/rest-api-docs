Retrieves a list of entities. To avoid hitting URL length limits, always use this version of the query call rather than the GET version for `where` values that exceed 7500 characters in length. The query is performed against the database. The `where` field in the request body accepts Java Persistance Query Language (JPQL) syntax, which is similar SQL syntax.  Accessing data via that database is only performant when you query very specific data. Otherwise, it is preferable to use the [Search](#search) call when it is available for the entity type for which you want to search.

<aside class="notice">NOTE: At least one of the required parameters(fields and layout)Â or both must be specified.</aside>

### HTTP Request

`{corpToken}/query/{entity}?fields={fields}&orderBy={fields}&count={count}&start={start}`

Parameter | Required | Description
------ | -------- | -----
fields | yes* | Comma-separated list of field names. Use fields or layout, but not both.
layout | yes* | Name of a configured layout. Use fields or layout, but not both.
showReadOnly | no | (true/false) Whether to show read-only fields. Only applies when the layout parameter is used.
count | no | Limit on the number of records to return. If the set of matched results is larger than count, cap the returned results at size count.
start | no | From the set of matched results, return record numbers start through (start + count)
orderBy | no | Name of property on which to base the order of returned entities.
meta | no | off, basic, or full. Default is off (no meta). Returns metadata that describes the structure of returned entity data.
showEditable | no | (true/false) Whether to show the _editable field in responses. The _editable field indicates whether an entity is editable. Default value is false.
totalOnly | no | (true/false) When set to true, only the total count of records matching the where body is returned. In this scenario, only the where body is required and all other parameters are ignored.
BhRestToken | no | Token that represents a session established by the login process. Must be sent with all subsequent requests to the API. The session key can be provided in the BhRestToken query string, a cookie, or an HTTP header.

<aside class="warning">Returns an HTTP 404 if the requested entity cannot be found, if fields are specified that do not exist on the specified entity, or if values for any mandatory fields with no default value are not included.</aside>
