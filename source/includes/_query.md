# Query

## <span class="tag">GET</span> /query

The `Query` call retrieves a list of entitys. The query is performed against the database, therefore the `where` parameter should reflect SQL syntax.  Access the data via that database is only performant when query very specific data, otherwised it is preferred that you use the [Search](/#search) call.

<aside class="notice">NOTE: At least one of the required parameters(fields and layout)Â or both must be specified.</aside>

        "firstName" : "Alanzo",
        "lastName" : "Smith"
    }]
}
