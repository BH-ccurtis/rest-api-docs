The `Query` call retrieves a list of entities. The query is performed against the database. The `where` parameter accepts Java Perstance Language (JPQL) syntax, which is similar SQL syntax.  Access the data via that database is only performant when query very specific data, otherwised it is preferred that you use the [Search](/#search) call.
